Git is a pretty rad system that allows us to effectively keep history of collections of files on several machines.
To do this, we have some basic commands:

Commit - Probably the most common command, which takes your current staged files and saves a record of changes
Fetch  - Checks to see if there are any changes on the remote repository
Pull   - Gets any changes that are on the current branch of the remote repository and applies them to your local branch
Push   - Applies your changes to your local branch to the remote branch
Merge  - Applies the changes made on a source branch to a destination branch, which is almost always followed by deleting the secondary branch

Status - Gets a list of changed files, and prompts you to commit those changes
Branch - Depending on the key that we add after, this allows us to change branches, as well as create new ones

There are a handful more commands that can be used, but are much less common, so those will be left out
